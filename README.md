- 👋 Hi, I’m @rybristow
- 👀 I’m interested in creating software that makes a difference. I have a special interest in mobile development, but have not had opportunities recently in that space.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about iOS development, game development with Unity, and having fun learning modeling in Blender!
- 🛠 Languages I like: 'java', 'python', 'swift', 'objective-c', 'c++', 'c#'
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything creative! I love learning new coding languages and new skills!
